# In Depth

## Runtime

### Interpreter

A lot of work has been put in stabilising and passing our test suite. Progress has been quite fast and we now pass most of the runtime, mcs, mscorlib and Mono.Debugger.Soft test suites. We are also reaching the point where the Interpreter is able to build the full BCL with MCS.

### IBM AIX and IBM i

@NattyNarwhal has made the great effort of porting Mono on [IBM AIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AIX) and [i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i)! While a lot does work, such as BoringTLS, other things do not, such as the ahead-of-time compiler or Roslyn. For any question about this port, please join the discussion on our Gitter channel at http://gitter.im/mono/mono/.

### Haiku

@NattyNarwhal has also made the [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/) port support amd64; unfortunately neither i386 and amd64 work just yet due to various runtime termination issues.

### WebAssembly

The WebAssembly port features better support through the Mono SDKs effort and several issues were fixed around GC and class libraries

### Jemalloc

We now have an option to support [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/) as the malloc(3) library, its speed allows for faster desktop applications. You'll need to compile Mono with `--with-jemalloc` to enable it and then set `MONO_USE_JEMALLOC` environment variable at runtime. Jemalloc is known to have much better performance than system memory allocators and is safe in concurrent/re-entrant situations.

### Profiler: improved GC roots reporting

A rework of the mechanism to report GC roots allows both the Xamarin.Profiler as well as mprof-report to better track their lifetimes.

### PAL

Added support for nanosecond resolution in file information on platforms where the information is available.

### Diagnostic enhancements

The diagnostic support to inspect generated native code via `MONO_VERBOSE_METHOD` environement variable was extended to support multiple entries.


## Class Libraries

HttpWebRequests async handling has been rewritten. This resolves many long-standing hard reproduce issues involving requests cancellation or
timeout. As HttpWebRequests is used as underlying implementation by other types this should improve the reliability of a broad range of types.

A few internal types were decorated with StackTraceHiddenAttribute to produce more readable managed stack-traces. The improvement will be
most noticeable in scenarios involving ExceptionDispatchInfo (e.g. async stack-traces).

System.Security assembly System.Security.Cryptography.Xml namespace has been replaced with CoreFX implementation. This makes Mono XML Signature (also called XMLDSig) support highly compatible with .NET.

ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib assembly was marked as obsolete and will be removed in future releases. We recommend replacing the very old implementation
we ship with nuget package available at https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpZipLib/

## Tools

### illinkanalyzer

A new tool Linker analyzer available as `illinkanalyzer` was introduced. It helps in advanced scenarios to analyze dependencies, which were recorded during linker processing and led linker to mark an item to keep it in the resulting linked assembly.

### VB.NET compiler

We now ship Roslyn based VB.NET compiler. This is fully featured VB.NET compiler also available via `vbc` command which supports significantly more features than old `vbnc` compiler.
